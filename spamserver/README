SPAMSERVER - Example application using OTP (Open Telecom Platform).


The logic is totally dumb, but it's a trivial, nice and working piece of
software. A stupid server runs, processess can be subscribed and they get
beaconed once per second. Processess can also be unsubscribed.

Here is an example 'erl' session showing the usage:

    5> c(spamserver).
    {ok,spamserver}
    6> spamserver:start().
    {ok,<0.59.0>}
    7> spamserver ! culo.
    culo
    Got culo, don't get thatâ€¦
    8> c(test).
    {ok,test}
    9> [P, Q] = [spawn(test, listen_and_print, []) || _ <- [1,2]].
    [<0.67.0>,<0.68.0>]
    10> spamserver:insert(P).
    ok
    I've got 'spam'
    ...
    I've got 'spam'
    11> spamserver:insert(Q).
    ok
    I've got 'spam'
    I've got 'spam'
    ...
    I've got 'spam'
    I've got 'spam'
    12> spamserver:remove(P).
    Got targets! Starting spam
    ok
    I've got 'spam'
    I've got 'spam'
    ...
    I've got 'spam'
    I've got 'spam'
    13> spamserver:remove(Q).
    No targets! Stopping spam
    ok
