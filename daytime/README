Some time ago I've seen a cool gmail theme which updates the color of the
background basing on the current time. I found that nice, and I tought
about how could would be to have a time-updating desktop wallpaper!

Then some time passed, until in this period I decided to learn the Perl
programming language. I thought this is a good idea despite I already know
Python: a lot of legacy stuff is written in Perl>, and that makes it a
good thing to put into a Resum√®!

As I became more familiar with the language I decided to write this
program. From time to time it changes your desktop gradient according to
the time of the day. You may fully appreciate it when combined with a
transparent-png wallpaper!

It works by default under GNOME2, but also GNOME3 is supported.
Unfortunately it sucks a lot of CPU, which is weird, since it sleeps in
background and wakes up from time to time. This could be due to the crappy
perl implementation of "sleep" (?).
