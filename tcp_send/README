A simple two-processes send-receive in TCP

Point: building up a tcp socket in C is usually a mess:
 -  Pig-disgusting APIs provided by our poor legacy C library;
 -  Bad enough non-reentrant stuff from everywhere
 -  A hard to remember sequence of calls to achieve in the correct way

This program is simple: it forks into a server and a client. The client
sends "hello world" to the server, and that's it. The implementation,
however, is correct, robust and reentrant in all its parts.
