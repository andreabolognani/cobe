Suppose you're about to start a build for a project you're working on.

You know it's going to take some time, so it would be the perfect time to
catch up on your emails; on the other hand, you're aware of the fact that
some of the new code you've just added might cause the build to fail.

The solution: instead of starting the build using, ie.

	$ make

you start it like

	$ notify-after make

The notify-after script will start the build for you, and pop up a nice
notification after it has completed, either succesfully or unsuccesfully:
this way, you can stop checking your build every ten seconds and spend
the build time doing something useful[1].


[1] http://xkcd.com/303/ is of course a possibility, but you'll have to
    make sure the notification daemon plays a sound as well.
