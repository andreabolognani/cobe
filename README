CODE! - CODE Often Delivers Entertainment!
==========================================

Just a dumping ground for those random silly programs you happen to write
when you can't bring yourself to study, or when you are trying out a new
programming language, or when you have a clever idea which unfortunately
has little to no pratical use.

Don't take coding too seriously: enjoying it is important, too.
