Cobe - Coding Ought to Be Entertaining
======================================

Just a dumping ground for those random silly programs you happen to write
when you can't bring yourself to study, or when you are trying out a new
programming language, or when you have a clever idea which unfortunately
has little to no practical use.

Don't take coding too seriously: enjoying it just as important.

Structure of the repository
---------------------------

- Place modules into the "/lib/$lang" directory, where $lang is your
  programming language of choice;
- Build a directory for each program;
- Optionally (i.e. for non-trivial programs) put a README file inside the
  program's directory.
