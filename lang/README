A long time ago (yesterday) War asked us whether we knew about a language
training software. The idea is pretty trivial:
- the program writes a word
- you write back the translation

Challenge accepted, I wrote it in a few rows of python. :D
The program is totally stupid, doesn't collect any statistics and allows
you to provide just one translation for each wordâ€¦ I wrote it in 10 minutes
just for fun.

You'll need a dictionary: the 'dict.txt' file is a valid example.
