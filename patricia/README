A working-but-not-so-intelligent C++ implementation of the patricia-tree
algorithm. It's a variant of the radix-tree algorithm.

I implemented this piece of crap just for fun. You know, when you have a
lot of important stuff to do very quickly, and you waste your time in
something totally useless, just because you are sad for your tiny amount
of time… for your *actual* job…

This implementation works, in the sense it can print a patricia-tree using
graphviz… but lacks both of style and the (essential!) lookup
functionality! So basically it sucks.
