tiles-puzzle
============

This applications solves a simple puzzle involving tiles with images
printed on them.

There are nine tiles, each one looks like this

	 -------
	|   o   |
	| +   o |
	|   o   |
	 -------

where "o" is the top of an image and "+" is the bottom; each part has
one of four colors.

Tiles are arranged in a 3x3 grid, and the puzzle is solved if all images
formed where two tiles touch one another (12 in total) are complete. An
image is complete if it's formed by a top and a bottom, and both parts
are of the same color.

A lot of the code is devoted to make JavaScript behave a little more like
a pure functional programming language, eg. not modifying lists in place.
Maybe I should just have coded it in Scheme ;)
