General purpose Makefiles

-- Makefile.c-cc----------------------------------------------------------

You may need to compile something on-the-fly, without caring much about
dependencies, auto-tools and stuff. For instance, let's say you've a bunch
of C or C++ files, one of which has a `main` function. You want to compile
them at once in the most simple way possible. The Makefile.c-cc can
compile at a glance a small one-directory project: just copy on your
directory, strip away the `.c-cc` extension, and here you go!

Notice: inside the Makefile I'm using the `cc` file extension for C++. You
may want to change it into `cpp` for some projects in which this extension
is used.
